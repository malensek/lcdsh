# lcdsh

This is a small bash 'library' for manipulating LCD displays driven by [LCDproc](http://lcdproc.sourceforge.net). Rather than implementing the wide range of widgets supported by LCDproc, lcdsh is focused on reducing the friction required to display basic text messages on the screen. Ideally, sending a message to the LCD should be as simple as piping some text.
